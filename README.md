# University Attendance System

Welcome to our Java-based Attendance System! This desktop application is designed with a focus on efficiency and user-friendliness to streamline attendance management processes in educational institutions.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: The system employs the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure a clear separation of concerns in the codebase, making it easy to maintain and extend.

- **Robust Backend**: With a well-structured backend, the system incorporates best practices to ensure reliability and scalability.

- **Three Dashboards**: The system offers three distinct dashboards for students, faculty, and administrators, providing tailored experiences and facilitating a streamlined attendance management process.

## Tech Stack

- **Java Swing**: The user interface of the application is built using Java Swing, providing a rich and interactive experience for users.

- **MySQL**: The system uses MySQL as the backend database to store and manage attendance data efficiently.

## Layered Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture to ensure modularity and scalability:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Responsible for handling user interactions and displaying information to users through the Java Swing interface.
   
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Implements the core logic of the application, including attendance tracking, user authentication, and data validation.

3. **Data Access Layer**: Manages interactions with the MySQL database, including querying and updating attendance data.
